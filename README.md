This is a bit of fun with Conway's game of life

Live cells are my face.

It uses the same cell object that I created and the cells 

keep track of their history.  That means you can rewind according to the

cells history.

If you were just using the algorithm you can not rewind in the game of life

>Conway's life is forward-deterministic.  A given pattern leads to one and only one, sequel pattern.  Life is not backward-deterministic. a pattern usually has many patterns that may have preceded it. In short a configuration has only one future but (usually) many possible pasts.
